# Module: `stdgo.encoding`

[(view library index)](../stdgo.md)


# Overview


Package encoding defines interfaces shared by other packages that  
convert data to and from byte\-level and textual representations.  
Packages that check for these interfaces include encoding/gob,  
encoding/json, and encoding/xml. As a result, implementing an  
interface once can make a type useful in multiple encodings.  
Standard types that implement these interfaces include time.Time and net.IP.  
The interfaces come in pairs that produce and consume encoded data.

## typedef BinaryMarshaler


```haxe
typedef BinaryMarshaler = {
	public function marshalBinary():{
		_1:stdgo.Error;
		_0:stdgo.Slice<stdgo.GoByte>;
	};
};
```


BinaryMarshaler is the interface implemented by an object that can  
marshal itself into a binary form.  



MarshalBinary encodes the receiver into a binary form and returns the result.  



## typedef BinaryUnmarshaler


```haxe
typedef BinaryUnmarshaler = {
	public function unmarshalBinary(_data:stdgo.Slice<stdgo.GoByte>):stdgo.Error;
};
```


BinaryUnmarshaler is the interface implemented by an object that can  
unmarshal a binary representation of itself.  



UnmarshalBinary must be able to decode the form generated by MarshalBinary.  
UnmarshalBinary must copy the data if it wishes to retain the data  
after returning.  



## typedef TextMarshaler


```haxe
typedef TextMarshaler = {
	public function marshalText():{
		_1:stdgo.Error;
		_0:stdgo.Slice<stdgo.GoByte>;
	};
};
```


TextMarshaler is the interface implemented by an object that can  
marshal itself into a textual form.  



MarshalText encodes the receiver into UTF\-8\-encoded text and returns the result.  



## typedef TextUnmarshaler


```haxe
typedef TextUnmarshaler = {
	public function unmarshalText(_text:stdgo.Slice<stdgo.GoByte>):stdgo.Error;
};
```


TextUnmarshaler is the interface implemented by an object that can  
unmarshal a textual representation of itself.  



UnmarshalText must be able to decode the form generated by MarshalText.  
UnmarshalText must copy the text if it wishes to retain the text  
after returning.
