        Sort accepts a map and returns a SortedMap that has the same keys and

        raised by unorderable key values such as NaNs.
        
        The ordering rules are more general than with Go's < operator:
        
          - when applicable, nil compares low
          - ints, floats, and strings order by <
          - NaN compares less than non-NaN floats
          - bool compares false before true
          - complex compares real, then imag
          - pointers compare by machine address
          - channel values compare by machine address
          - structs compare each field in turn
          - arrays compare each element in turn.
            Otherwise identical arrays compare by length.
          - interface values compare first by reflect.Type describing the concrete type
            and then by concrete value as described in the previous rules.
