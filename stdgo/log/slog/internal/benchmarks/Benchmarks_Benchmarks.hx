/**
    Package benchmarks contains benchmarks for slog.
    
    These benchmarks are loosely based on github.com/uber-go/zap/benchmarks.
    They have the following desirable properties:
    
      - They test a complete log event, from the user's call to its return.
    
      - The benchmarked code is run concurrently in multiple goroutines, to
        better simulate a real server (the most common environment for structured
        logs).
    
      - Some handlers are optimistic versions of real handlers, doing real-world
        tasks as fast as possible (and sometimes faster, in that an
        implementation may not be concurrency-safe). This gives us an upper bound
        on handler performance, so we can evaluate the (handler-independent) core
        activity of the package in an end-to-end context without concern that a
        slow handler implementation is skewing the results.
    
      - We also test the built-in handlers, for comparison.
